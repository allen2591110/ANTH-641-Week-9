# ANTH 641 Week 9 - Exercise: Data Visualization in Different Ways

_One of the most informative ways to investigate data is to visualize it in graphical form. In week 8 we experimented a bit with visualizing some data in R. This week we’ll do a bit more with R, while also comparing it to [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/), an open source data visualization framework. What you should get out of this exercise is a taste of what different types of data visualization can bring to archaeological research and exposure to some possibilities in your own research. Sometimes, graphical representation of data is about experimentation; you may be able to identify a pattern in the data with one type of visualization that isn’t apparent with another._ 

_We can do the first part of this exercise in two ways: through RStudio in Binder or in RStudio on your own computers. I recommend the latter, but if you do not want to install the application on your on computer, the former will work as well._

If you choose to use RStudio through Binder, create a new Jupyter notebook environment with mybinder.org for this week’s forked GitHub repo (as you’ve done in the past). 

If you choose to use RStudio on your own computer, make sure it is downloaded (you can get it from [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)). It will have you download R if you don’t already have it. When you open RStudio on your computer, set up a folder that will be your “working directory” – this is where you can put any data you want to import into R or anything you want to export from R. Click on the ellipses on the right side of the screen, in the files section of RStudio (see below).
