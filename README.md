# ANTH 641 Week 9 - Exercise: Data Visualization in Different Ways

_One of the most informative ways to investigate data is to visualize it in graphical form. In week 8 we experimented a bit with visualizing some data in R. This week we’ll do a bit more with R, while also comparing it to [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/), an open source data visualization framework. What you should get out of this exercise is a taste of what different types of data visualization can bring to archaeological research and exposure to some possibilities in your own research. Sometimes, graphical representation of data is about experimentation; you may be able to identify a pattern in the data with one type of visualization that isn’t apparent with another._ 

_We can do the first part of this exercise in two ways: through RStudio in Binder or in RStudio on your own computers. I recommend the latter, but if you do not want to install the application on your on computer, the former will work as well._

If you choose to use RStudio through Binder, create a new Jupyter notebook environment with mybinder.org for this week’s forked GitHub repo (as you’ve done in the past). 

If you choose to use RStudio on your own computer, make sure it is downloaded (you can get it from [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)). It will have you download R if you don’t already have it. When you open RStudio on your computer, set up a folder that will be your “working directory” – this is where you can put any data you want to import into R or anything you want to export from R. Click on the ellipses on the right side of the screen, in the files section of RStudio (see below).

Choose the folder location on your computer. Then Click on the “More” dropdown and choose “Set as Working Directory.”

Now we’re set to visualize some data. 

## Graphical Visualization with R
_If you’re using RStudio on Binder, ignore the next sentence. If you’re using RStudio on your computer, download the Rscript file “Week9” from the GitHub repo and put it in your R working directory (set up above)._

_In RStudio, click on the Week9.r file in the bottom right region, which will open the Rscript file in the top left of the screen. Follow these instructions to complete this part of the exercise._

_At the end of the exercise, you should have two csv files and three graphs/plots in your directory. If you’re using RStudio on Binder, make sure to download these files onto your own computer – upload the three images to your GitHub repo._

## Graphical Visualization with RAWGraphs: DartPoints
_[RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) is an open source data visualization framework. We’re going to use it to exercise our creativity with data visualization._ 

1. First, open the DartPoint.csv file. In the first column, the first row is empty – name it “ID.” We only need to do this so that every column has a title. Save it. 

2. Go to [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) and click “USE IT NOW!”

3. With the DartPoint.csv file open (in Excel or whatever spreadsheet software you’re using), copy all. On RAWGraphs, paste your data.
