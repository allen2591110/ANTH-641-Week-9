# ANTH 641 Week 9 - Exercise: Data Visualization in Different Ways

_One of the most informative ways to investigate data is to visualize it in graphical form. In week 8 we experimented a bit with visualizing some data in R. This week we’ll do a bit more with R, while also comparing it to [RAWGraphs](rawgraphs.io), an open source data visualization framework. What you should get out of this exercise is a taste of what different types of data visualization can bring to archaeological research and exposure to some possibilities in your own research. Sometimes, graphical representation of data is about experimentation; you may be able to identify a pattern in the data with one type of visualization that isn’t apparent with another._
